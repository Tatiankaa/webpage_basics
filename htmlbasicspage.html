        <h2>Understanding HTML</h2>
        <p>HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard language for creating and designing web pages. It provides a structured way to organize content and elements on a webpage, defining the structure and layout.</p>
        <p>Key HTML elements include headings, paragraphs, lists, links, images, forms, and more. HTML tags are used to mark up and define the structure of content, ensuring proper display in web browsers. Now, let's explain the basics.</p>

	<h3>Anatomy of an HTML element</h3>
	<img src="img_htmlanatomy.jpg" alt="Sentence to show how HTML works">
        <p>The main parts of our element are as follows:</p>
	The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or 	starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.
	<p>The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case 	where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.</p>
	<p>The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text. </p>
	<p>The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.</p>
