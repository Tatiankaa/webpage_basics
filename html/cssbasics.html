        <h2>Exploring CSS</h2>
        <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a powerful styling language used to control the presentation and layout of HTML documents. CSS describes how HTML elements 	are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. It saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</p>
        <h3>Anatomy of a CSS ruleset</h3>
	<img src="img_anatomyofaCSSruleset.jpg" alt="How CSS works">
	<p>The whole structure is called a ruleset. (The term ruleset is often referred to as just rule.) Note the names of the individual parts:</p>
<table>
            <tr>
                <th>Tag</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>selector</td>
                <td>This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It defines the element(s) to be styled (in this example, &lt;p &gt; elements). To style a different element, change the selector.</td>
            </tr>

            <tr>
                <td>properties</td>
                <td>These are ways in which you can style an HTML element. (In this example, color is a property of the &lt;p &gt; elements.) In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect in the rule.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>property value</td>
                <td>To the right of the property—after the colon—there is the property value. This chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property. (For example, there are many color values in addition to red.)</td>
            </tr>
<tr>
                <td>declaration</td>
                <td>This is a single rule like color: red;. It specifies which of the element's properties you want to style.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>color</td>
                <td>Sets the text color of an element.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>font-size</td>
                <td>Sets the size of the text font.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>margin</td>
                <td>Sets the margin space around an element.</td>
            </tr>
